    <p>The reason why I chose this topic for my final project is that I love to eat different kinds of cuisine from around the world. (I will put more information for the Final Submission)</p>
    <p>Cuisine refers to a type of food prepared in a particular style, influenced by the ingredients, region, and traditions of a specific culture. The way food is cooked can reveal a lot about the history and environment of a place. For instance, if you're craving cannoli, visiting Chinatown wouldnâ€™t be the best choice, as cheese-filled desserts are more closely tied to Italian cuisine than Chinese food. Understanding cuisine helps us recognize the unique flavors and customs that define different cultures around the world.</p>
