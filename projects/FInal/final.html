        <h3>1. The title and topic of your site.</h3>
        <p>My favorite Cuisine (Ice cream, Sichuan cuisine, Sushi & Sashimi, Seafood, Udon)</p>

        <h3>2. A brief paragraph about why you choose this topic.</h3>
        <p>The reason why I choose this as the topic of my final project is because I was eating ice cream while I am doing this homework and I love to eat all the time, so I want to share about my favorite food in my life so far.</p>

        <h3>3. List out the content you will have on the home page and each of the five pages (one will have a table).</h3>
        <p>On the home page, I will put the introduction and the definition of cuisine. Each page I will put at least one picture of the food and the voting page I will include the table (Different people vote for different cusine).</p>

        <h3>4. What fields (or information you will collect) will you put into your form? What data will go on your table?</h3>
        <p>I will collect information and make a table for the data that I collect from the form.</p>
        <p>I will use the form fields by asking different people's around the campus about their favorite cuisine. </p>

        <h3>5. How will you collect information/images/content for your site? You need at least 5 references on your site, list out at least 2 of references you plan on using.</h3>
        <p>I will collect images on Pinterest. <br> I will use the Internet (DIfferent websites) to collect information. <br>I will use (https://www.vocabulary.com/dictionary/cuisine) and (https://www.britannica.com/topic/ice-cream)</p>
