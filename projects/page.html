            <p>Pandas are black-and-white bears from China that love eating bamboo. They live in mountain forests and spend most of their time eating or resting. Pandas are gentle and mostly live alone, except during mating season.</p>
            <p>Pandas were once endangered due to habitat loss, but conservation efforts have helped them. They are now "vulnerable," but protection is still needed. Pandas are a symbol of wildlife conservation worldwide.</p>
