    <h1><u>Hello, my name is Ting Yan Ng (Yankie)</u></h1>
    <p>I am from Hong Kong. I grow up in a city called Ma On Shan with my family. I have two older brothers and they studied in BYUH before just like me. </p>
    
    <p>These are my hobbies below:</p>

    <blockquote><ol type="A">

        <li>Playing Basketball</li>
        <li>Singing</li>

    </ol></blockquote>

    <p>I served my mission in <b>Hong Kong</b>. My mission languages are <var>Cantonese</var> and <var>Mandarin</var>. I really enjoyed my experience in my mission. I learned how to become a better person and gain a lot of testimony of the Gospel of Jesus Christ.</p>
