        <p>The world is the totality of entities, the whole of reality, or everything that exists. The nature of the world has been conceptualized differently in different fields. Some conceptions see the world as unique, while others talk of a "plurality of worlds".</p>
        <h3>What is normal flow in HTML?</h3>
        <p>Normal flow is the default layout in HTML. Block elements stack, while inline elements stay in line.</p>
        <h3>What does float do? Why do you need to clear the float?</h3>
        <p>Float moves an element left or right, and clearing it prevents layout issues by restoring normal flow.</p>
        <h3>What do absolute, fixed, and relative do?</h3>
        <p>Relative moves an element without affecting others, absolute places it based on its nearest positioned ancestor, and fixed keeps it in place on the screen.</p>
        <h3>How can you make nice navigation buttons for mobile devices?</h3>
        <p>Use flexbox or grid for layout, make buttons large and easy to tap, use clear labels or icons, and ensure good spacing and contrast.</p>
        <h3>Where can you find videos to review what we talked about in class?</h3>
        <p>In the Canvas Lecture Notes</p>
